# JavaFX-Checkers-Game
A game of checkers which me and my teammates made using the JavaFX library. The game isn't finished and it's uncertain if it ever will be, it currently works rather semi-well.

## Features
- Main menu with Play, How To Play, Settings and Close Button
- Configuration files that are being used to store and read data
- A checkerboard with pieces and a turn based system, which lets each player do one move before switching to the other
